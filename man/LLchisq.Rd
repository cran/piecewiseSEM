\usage{
LLchisq(
  modelList,
  basis.set = NULL,
  direction = NULL,
  interactions = FALSE,
  conserve = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelList}{A list of structural equations created using \code{psem}.}

\item{basis.set}{An optional list of independence claims.}

\item{direction}{A \code{vector} of claims defining the specific
directionality of independence claims; for use in special cases (see
 \code{\link{dSep}}.}

\item{interactions}{whether interactions should be included in basis set. 
Default is FALSE}

\item{conserve}{Whether the most conservative log-likelihood should be returned;
for use in special cases (see Details). Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
a data.frame corresponding to the Chi-squared statistic, d.f., and P-value
}
\description{
Derivation of log-likelihoods to be used in determining the
goodness-of-fit for piecewise structural equation models.
}
\details{
Here, a list of saturated models is first derived from the list of
structured equations using the basis set. Then, the differences in summed
log-likelihoods are computed and used to calculate the Chi-squared statistic.
